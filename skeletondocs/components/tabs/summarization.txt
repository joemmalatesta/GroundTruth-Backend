This documentation provides details about the usage of Tab, TabAnchor, and TabGroup components within a Svelte-based UI framework. It walks through the following key features:

Overview:

Explains the use of tabs for switching between different views and pages, with a focus on maintaining a consistent user experience.
Tabs Components:

Tab: Provides guidance on implementing a basic tab interface that manages panel content using an active selection state.
TabAnchor: Offers a way to switch between different routes, with recommendations to avoid certain attributes like target="_blank".
Customization:

Instructions on configuring properties such as justify, active states, hover effects, and layout for flexibility in positioning and styling.
Examples and Code Previews:

Provides several usage examples, complete with TypeScript and HTML code snippets for embedding TabGroup components, defining tab states, and linking content dynamically with Svelte's $page store.
Additional Functionality:

Discusses the use of Svelte stores to manage tab states persistently, and how to implement them with Skeleton's Local Storage Store for persistence across sessions.
The documentation serves as both a functional guide and a code reference for developers utilizing the tab components within their applications.
